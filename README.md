# RegressionVisualization

Regression Visualization is a gradio interface where the user can learn about logistic and linear regression. It utilizes Python, PyTorch, NumPy, and gradio. You can play with the interface [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Cippppy/RegressionVisualization)

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Any IDE you know how to use
* Python
* Gradio
* Altair
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Pandas

### Installing

The easiest ways to install the dependent python packages is to use the "requirments.txt" file. You do this by using the command prompt that aligns with your python environment (making sure you are inside the correct environment) and running the command "pip install -r requirements.txt".
